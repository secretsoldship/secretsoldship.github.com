For example, share a link from Safari on your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Vision Pro, and have it open in the default browser on your Mac moments later.

You can send a link even if your iOS/visionOS device and/or Mac is offline. The link will be sent and received the next time the devices are online. The link will never be lost.

My personal use-case is that I often discover cool stuff when I check Twitter on the go and I want to dig deeper into it later on my Mac. I have tried Instapaper, Pocket, Safari Reading List, iCloud Tabs, and more. The problem with them all is that I forget to check them.

#### Privacy

The app uses iCloud syncing to securely send links from your iOS/visionOS device to your Mac. The app developer will not see the links you share. The app does not collect any personal data and does not have any tracking.

### Troubleshooting

- Try restarting both devices.
- Try opening the Hyperduck iOS app to force a sync.
- Ensure you are on the latest operating system version.
- Ensure both devices are signed into the same iCloud account.
- Ensure both devices are online.
- Ensure Hyperduck is running on the Mac.
- Hyperduck opens links in the background. Ensure you didn't miss it.
- Ensure Low Power Mode is not enabled on the devices. It can cause iCloud to delay syncing.
- On iOS, ensure Hyperduck is enabled in “Settings › Apple ID › iCloud › Apps Using iCloud”.
- On macOS, ensure Hyperduck is enabled in “System Settings › Apple ID › iCloud › iCloud Drive › Apps syncing to iCloud Drive”.
- If it's a work device, make sure there are no restrictions in place that prevents iCloud or iCloud Drive.
- If using a VPN, try disconnecting it, as some VPNs can interfere with iCloud syncing.
- Check the [iCloud system status](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/) to ensure the service is not experiencing issues.
- In the iOS app, if you triple-tap the text, it will show the most recently shared URLs, which may aid debugging.

### Tips

#### Run shortcuts {#shortcuts}

You can use this app to trigger [shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios) on your Mac from your iOS devices. This enables a lot of powerful use-cases. For example, you could make your Mac play a specific song directly from your iPhone.

First, create a shortcut on your Mac with some actions. Let's call it `Unicorn`.

On your iOS device, make a new shortcut, add the “Run Shortcut on Mac” action, and write `Unicorn` in the shortcut field.

You can now run this shortcut on your iOS device to trigger the `Unicorn` shortcut on your Mac.

#### Shut down Mac

You can use the Shortcuts support mentioned above to shut down your computer remotely from your iOS device. Just follow the above steps and use the “Shut Down” action (requires macOS 13.3) in the Shortcuts app or the AppleScript action with the following: `tell app "System Events" to shut down`.

#### Trigger Raycast deeplinks {#raycast}

Similar to the above, we can use a [Raycast deeplink](https://manual.raycast.com/deeplinks).

For example, on your iOS device, make a new shortcut, add the “Send URLs to Mac” action, and in the URL field, write:

```
raycast://confetti
```

You can now trigger confetti to show up on your Mac from your iPhone.

#### Send a link to a specific browser profile

Create an [iOS shortcut that triggers a macOS shortcut](#shortcuts) and set it to appear in the share sheet. In the macOS shortcut, use the "Open URLs" action from my [Velja](/velja) app to open the URL in a specific browser profile.

- [Example iOS shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a00ac5bb31294084936fbd4dd6ca0245)
- [Example macOS shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d39c57b67ed343d58192a899841d6457)

#### How is it better than the Firefox tab sync?

- Works in any app with a share sheet, not just Firefox

#### Can it open links in a specific browser on my Mac?

You can use my free [Velja app](/velja) for this. Create a custom rule where you set Hyperduck as the source app.

#### The link did not open on my Mac right away

The app works by syncing the link over iCloud from your iOS device to your Mac. This is usually instantaneous, but there can be situations that delay it (iCloud problems, network issues, Low Power Mode, etc). This is unfortunately completely out of my control.

#### I don't see the “Send to Mac” action in the share sheet

Try restarting your device. Because of a iOS bug, it sometimes only appears after a restart.

#### The “Send to Mac” button does not appear when viewing a PDF file in Safari

Safari tries to share the PDF file itself, not the URL to the PDF, and Hyperduck can only handle URLs. Instead, go back, long-press the link to the PDF, and tap “Share”.

#### I use the Arc browser and I am not receiving all links

The Arc browser does not support opening multiple URLs at the time. I suggest sending feedback to the Arc team about this. There is nothing Hyperduck can do about it.

As a workaround, you could use my free [Velja app](/velja) to make such links open in a different browser. Create a custom rule where you set Hyperduck as the source app and set the destination app to a different browser than Arc.

#### Can Hyperduck lose a shared link if my internet goes down?

No. Hyperduck stores your link in iCloud, ensuring it's available until successfully opened on your Mac, regardless of your internet connection quality.

#### Can you add a history screen to the iOS app?

I don't plan to add this. I would like to keep the app focused on one thing and do it well. The app is for sending links from iOS to Mac. That's it.

If you really need to see what URLs were shared, you can triple-tap on the text in the iOS app to get a list of recently shared URLs.

#### Can you support multiple Macs?

No. I would like to keep the app simple.

#### Can you support the reverse - Mac to iOS?

No. That is not something I plan to support. It's simply not something I need myself and it would make the app much more complicated. Also, it would not be possible to open the URL directly in the browser like it does on macOS, so the experience would not be great.

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

I don't plan to localize the app.
